# What is JavaScript30

JavaScript 30 Day Challenge is created by @wesbos

Check out Wes' course at [https://JavaScript30.com](https://JavaScript30.com)

The idea is to build 30 projects with vanilla Javascript! No compiler, frameworks, or external libraries.

# Concepts Learned

I will be keeping track of the various JS concepts learned in my branch *study-notes*. The original Javascript30 starter file are kept on the *master* branch!
